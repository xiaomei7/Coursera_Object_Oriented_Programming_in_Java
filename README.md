Course work for Coursera Online class Object Oriented Programming in Java Specialization

## SPS = Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software
	1st course of the specialization 

### **Week 1** 
### **Week 2**
	Find genes from string or file.
	StorageResource.
### **Week 3**
	CSV Files and Basic Statistics in Java Module
	1. Use the open-source Apache Commons CSV package in your own Java programs;
	2. Access data from one or many CSV files using Java;
	3. Convert strings into numbers;
	4. Understand how to use “null” in Java programs (when you want to represent “nothing”);
	5. Devise an algorithm (and implement in Java) to answer questions about CSV data; and
